  - para1: NumPy forms the basis of powerful machine learning libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org). As machine learning grows, so does the list of libraries built on NumPy. [TensorFlowâ€™s](https://www.tensorflow.org) deep learning capabilities have broad applications &mdash; among them speech and image recognition, text-based applications, time-series analysis, and video detection. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), another deep learning library, is popular among researchers in computer vision and natural language processing. [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) is another AI package, providing blueprints and templates for deep learning.
    para2: Statistical techniques called [ensemble](https://towardsdatascience.com/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205) methods such as binning, bagging, stacking, and boosting are among the ML algorithms implemented by tools such as [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai) &mdash; one of the fastest inference engines. [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/) and [Eli5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer machine learning visualizations.
